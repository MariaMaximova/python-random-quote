Responsive is better than fast
It is not fully shipped until itâ€™s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law
